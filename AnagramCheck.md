Two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters used the same number of times.

For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.

Your task is to write a program that determines if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

The comparison should be case-insensitive (for example, 'a' is the same as 'A').

Input Format

● The first line contains an integer T — the number of test cases.

● For each test case, a single line contains two space-separated words, S1 and S2.

Output Format

For each test case, print "YES" if the strings are anagrams, and "NO" otherwise.
